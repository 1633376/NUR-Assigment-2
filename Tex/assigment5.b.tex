\begin{quote}

\textbf{Problem}
\begin{quote}
To check the robustness of your implementation make a plot of the x position of an individual particle and the value in cell 4 in 1 dimension and let x vary from the lowest value to the highest possible value in $x$. Repeat for cell 0.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Solution} 
\begin{quote}
There is not much to explain here, besides that the results for cell 4 and cell 0 are shown in the same plot. The code that creates the plots and the plots can be found below.

\textbf{Code - slices}

The code that creates the plots for cell 0 and cell 1.
