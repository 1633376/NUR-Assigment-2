\textbf{Problem}
\begin{quote}
Make plots of three Gaussian random fields, using $ n =-1$, $n= -2$ and $n= -3$. Give the plots a size of 1024. The axis should be in physical size. Choose a minimum physical size and explain how this impacts the maximum physical size, the minimum $k$ and maximum $k$.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Solution} 

\begin{quote}
The gaussian field are initial created in k-space by using  fourier shifted coordinates (i.e the zeroth wavenumber corresponds with the left top and not the center) and are then inverse fourier transformed. The method in which such a field is created in $k-$space consists of two steps. One, the shifted wavenumbers are used to create a matrix with complex numbers. Two, the matrix is given the correct hermitian symmetry. The first step is briefly explained in the code. The second step, how the matrix is given the correct symmetry, is described below. 
\\
\\
The hermitian symmetry that is necessary to make the ifft real requires that the complex number created with wavenumbers  $k_{x_i}, k_{y_j}$ should  be equal to the conjugate of the complex number created with wavenumbers $-k_{x_i}, -k_{y_j}$.  Let $N$ be the size of the $N \times N$ matrix  created in step one and let $c_{i,j}$ be the value in cell $i,j$. The matrix then has the correct hermitian symmetry if the following holds. % obtain the correct symmetry the following points should hold.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[A] \textbf{First row}: The value of matrix cell $c_{0,j}$ should be equal to the complex conjugate of the value in the matrix cell $c_{0,N-j}$ for $ 0 < j< N$. If $N$ is even then  the  value in cell $c_{0,N/2}$ should be equal to its own conjugate (i.e this value should only have a real component, because it is created with $k_0$ and $k_{nyquist}$).
\item[B] \textbf{First column}: This point is similar to the first point. The value of matrix cell $c_{i,0}$ should be equal to the complex conjugate of the value in the matrix cell $c_{N-i,0}$ for $0 < i < N$. If $N$ is even then t the  value in cell $c_{N/2,0}$ should be equal to its own conjugate (i.e this value should only have a real component, because it is created with $k_{nyquist}$ and $k_{0}$).
\item[C] \textbf{Inner matrix}: The value in cell $c_{i,j}$ should be equal to the complex conjugate in cell $c_{N-i,N-j}$ with $1 \leq i, j < N$. If the matrix is even then cell $c_{N/2,N/2}$ must be real, as it is created with $k_{nyquist}, k_{nyquist}$, of which its complex conjugate is equal to its self. %corresponds to the niquest matrix and must thereby be equal to its own complex conjugate.
\end{enumerate}

The matrix is as mentioned before first created with the shifted wavenumbers and is then given the correct symmetry. The code that makes the initial matrix, makes the matrix symmetric, creates the plots and the plots them self can be found below. The minimum physical size, the size of 1 cell, is chosen to be $ 1$ Mpc. This immediately fixes the maximum physical size as the grid must be 1024 $\times$ 1024. The maximum physical size is thus $ 1$ Mpc $ \times $ 1024 = 1024 Mpc. The minimum $k$ and maximum $k$ are fixed by the minimum and maximum size,

\begin{align}
k_{min} &= \frac{2 \pi}{ ( N \times \text{min distance} )} = \frac{2 \pi }{\text{max distance}} \\
k_{max} &= k_{nyquist} = \frac{2 \pi N}{ 2 \times ( N \times \text{ min distance} )} = \frac{ \pi}{\text{min distance}}
\end{align}

An increase in minimum distance would thus result in a smaller value for $k_{min}$ and a smaller value of $k_{max}$.
\\
One point to explicitly point out is that the same random uniform variables have been used to create the field for the different powers, $n = -1$, $n = -2$, $n = -3$. This was done to save computational time and has as consequence that the three created plots show the evolution of the fluctuations as function of the power $n$ (i.e the second plot and third plot show the same kind of structure, only with a different intensity).
